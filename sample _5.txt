A managed thread is either a background thread or a foreground thread. Background threads are identical to 
foreground threads with one exception: a background thread does not keep the managed execution environment running. 
Once all foreground threads have been stopped in a managed process (where the .exe file is a managed assembly), the 
system stops all background threads and shuts down. Note. When the runtime stops a background thread because the 
process is shutting down, no exception is thrown in the thread. However, when threads are stopped because the 
AppDomain.Unload method unloads the application domain, a ThreadAbortException is thrown in both foreground and 
background threads. Use the Thread.IsBackground property to determine whether a thread is a background or a 
foreground thread, or to change its status. A thread can be changed to a background thread at any time by setting 
its IsBackground property to true.
