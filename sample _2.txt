When threads are allowed to fail silently, without terminating the application, serious programming problems 
can go undetected. This is a particular problem for services and other applications that run for extended periods. 
As threads fail, program state gradually becomes corrupted. Application performance may degrade, or the application 
might become unresponsive. Allowing unhandled exceptions in threads to proceed naturally, until the operating system 
terminates the program, exposes such problems during development and testing. Error reports on program terminations 
support debugging.
